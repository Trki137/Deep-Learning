# Deep Learning - FER

This repository contains projects and lab exercises from the **Deep Learning** course at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER). The goal of these projects is to apply various deep learning techniques to practical tasks.

## Contents

The repository is organized into the following directories:

1. **Deep Models Intro**  
    Introductory projects in deep learning, where basic models such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and your first deep model are implemented. This section also includes work with the MNIST dataset.

2. **Convolutional Networks**  
    Projects focused on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are particularly effective for image recognition tasks. These projects explore different CNN architectures and techniques.

3. **Recurrent Neural Networks**  
    This section contains projects utilizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models, applied to tasks involving sequential data processing.

4. **Metric Embedding**  
    This section primarily focuses on metric learning using the triplet loss function, which is used to create embeddings that reflect the similarity between data points.
